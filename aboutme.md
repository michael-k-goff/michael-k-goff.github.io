### About The Project

This project is **Scaling in Human Societies**, a Living Literature Review of topics related to how cities, nations, and civilization as a whole develop with size. Our goal is to present research broadly related to scaling in a way that is comprehensive, up-to-date, understandable to a layperson, and relevant to researchers and policymakers.

### Funding

This project is generously supported by a [Living Literature Review](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/what-is-a-living-literature-review/) grant from Open Philanthropy. Open Philanthropy does not exercise editorial control over this project, and no content here should be construed as representing Open Philanthropy's views.

### About Me

This Living Literature Review is prepared by Michael Goff. I received a Ph. D. in Mathematics from University of Washington and did a postdoc at Vanderbilt University. For most of the past decade, I have been working on energy and environmental policy at [Urban Cruise Ship](https://www.urbancruiseship.org/), with a stint at [The Breakthrough Institute](https://thebreakthrough.org/).

I also have a personal blog at [Substack](https://goff.substack.com/), on which I write almost every week on a variety of topics.
